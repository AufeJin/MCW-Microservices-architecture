# Microservices architecture

## This workshop is no longer being maintained and will be archived on December 31, 2019.

Contoso Events is an online service for concerts, sporting and other event ticket sales. They are redesigning their solution for scale with a microservices strategy and want to implement a proof of concept (POC) for the path that receives the most traffic; ticket ordering.

## Target audience

- Application developer
- Infrastructure architect

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will look at the process of developing a proof of concept (POC) that will illustrate the use of many Azure features to support a highly scalable microservices architecture based on Service Fabric containers and Azure Functions.

By the end of this workshop you will be better able to design and deploy solutions based on Service Fabric containers and Azure Functions, in conjunction with other Azure features.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to design a solution that leverages aspects from microservices and serverless architectures to help an online concert ticket vendor survive the first five minutes of crushing load. You will handle the client's scaling needs through containerized microservices running on top of Service Fabric, and delegate the workload of tickets processing by using a storage queue for asynchronous processing and a globally distributed, high-performance database.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be able to design scalable microservices solutions involving .NET Core, Docker, Service Fabric, Azure Functions and Cosmos DB.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will construct an end-to-end Proof of concept for ticket ordering based on a microservices architecture based on Service Fabric and Azure Functions, alongside other supporting Azure features such as API Management, Web Apps, Azure Active Directory and Cosmos DB.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will better be able to build solutions that leverage these Azure features, in addition to gaining experience with deploying, scaling, upgrading and rolling back Service Fabric applications.
